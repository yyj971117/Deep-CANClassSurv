# Deep-CANClassSurv

## Abstract

### Background
Precision oncology requires integrated molecular profiling for accurate tumor classification and risk stratification. Current machine learning models often address these tasks separately, limiting their clinical utility.

### Model Introduction
**Deep-CANClassSurv** is an **attention-based two-stage deep learning framework with representation transfer learning** that:
- Integrates **multi-omics data**
- Classifies **38 tumor types**
- Stratifies **survival risk**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Two-stage Framework** | Decoupled classification and survival modeling via representation transfer |
| **Attention Mechanism** | Multi-head self-attention modules |
| **Interpretability** | SHAP analysis and embedding-based clustering |
| **Class Imbalance Handling** | Focal Loss implementation |

#### Two-stage Strategy

**Stage 1: Tumor Classification**
- Based on FT-Transformer with protein-protein interactions and protein-sequence embeddings; outputs a 512-dimensional representation
- The MSK-IMPACT dataset included **43,971** samples from AACR Project GENIE v14.0, with **37,000** samples for model training and **6,971** for validation
- Performance: **0.883** classification accuracy across 38 tumor types

**Stage 2: Survival Risk Stratification**
- The MSK-CHORD 2024 cohort with overall survival follow-up data included **16,378** overlapping patients from five major cancers, separated into **13,225** samples for model training and **3,153** for validation
- The transferred 512-dimensional embeddings undergo variance filtering (**threshold 0.001**), pairwise Pearson correlation filtering (**|r| > 0.95**), and Z-score normalization
- Model: Cox proportional hazards
- Performance: **C-index 0.74**, significant risk stratification (**log-rank p < 0.001**), with clear separation between high- and low-risk groups

**Figure 1. Overview of the Deep-CANClassSurv framework.** After preprocessing, feature selection, and multi-head self-attention-based representation learning, the model performs **(1) pan-cancer classification** and **(2) survival risk stratification**, together with interpretability analyses.

1. **Data processing and feature selection**  
   - Binary mutation/indel, CNV focal & arm-level calls, MSI-sensor, mutational signatures  
   - PPI network metrics: degree, PageRank, betweenness  
   - ESM2 embeddings + Euclidean/Cosine/Manhattan distances
   - Z-score normalization
   - Gated Feature Selector

2. **Model Architecture**  
   - **FT-Transformer** backbone with multi-head self-attention modules, followed by feed-forward neural network components, Squeeze-and-Excitation and residual normalization
   - **Focal Loss** to handle class imbalance
   - Softmax outputs over 38 classes
   - Generates a **512-dimensional patient embedding** for downstream prognosis modeling

3. **Survival Analysis**  
   - Transferred embeddings undergo variance filtering, correlation filtering, and Z-score normalization
   - **Cox Proportional Hazards** model
   - Kaplan–Meier stratification and log-rank tests

4. **Interpretability**  
   - **SHAP attribution** for prognostic feature interpretation
   - **Embedding-based clustering** for latent molecular structure analysis

# Installation and Usage

## Installation Guide

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yyj971117/Deep-CANClassSurv.git
cd Deep-CANClassSurv
```

2. **Create conda environment**
```bash
# For Ubuntu 18.04 (CUDA 11.8)
conda env create -f environment_18.yml

# For Ubuntu 22.04 (CUDA 12.4)
conda env create -f environment_22.yml
```

3. **Activate the environment**
```bash
conda activate Deep-CANClassSurv
```

## Usage

### Data Preparation

1. **Install bzip2**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y bzip2
```

2. **Extract dataset (.bz2 files)**
```bash
cd Deep-CANClassSurv/dataset/data_class

for f in *.bz2; do
    bunzip2 -k "$f"
done

cd Deep-CANClassSurv/dataset/data_os

for f in *.bz2; do
    bunzip2 -k "$f"
done
```

3. **Update file paths**
   > Update file paths in the Python scripts (e.g., lines 390-393, 396, 685-688, 692 in `main.py`; lines 633-636, 664 in `main_os.py`) to match your directory structure. For example, change `pd.read_csv('~/Deep-CANClassSurv/dataset/data_class/labels_test.csv')` to reflect your actual file locations.

### Running the Model

Choose the appropriate script based on your analysis needs:

- **Tumor classification only**: `main.py`
  - Performs only **Stage 1 (tumor type classification)**
  - Outputs classification results for 38 tumor types
  
- **Complete pipeline**: `main_os.py`
  - Runs the full two-stage workflow
  - **Stage 1: Tumor classification**
  - **Stage 2: Survival risk stratification**

### Example Usage
```bash
# Test data loading
python -c "
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('Deep-CANClassSurv/dataset/data_class/labels_test.csv')
print(f'Dataset loaded successfully: {df.shape}')
"

# For tumor classification only
python main.py
# For complete pipeline (classification + survival analysis)
python main_os.py
```

## Output

The model will generate:
- **Classification results**: Tumor type predictions with confidence scores
- **Survival analysis**: Risk stratification with hazard ratios and survival curves
- **Feature importance**: SHAP values for model interpretability
